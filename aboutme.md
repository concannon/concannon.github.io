My name is Connor Concannon.  I am a PhD candidate at the CUNY Graduate Center and the Deputy Director of Analytics at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. 

### My Interests

Besides the criminal justice system, I am interested in public sector data science, beer brewing, and chasing after toddlers.
